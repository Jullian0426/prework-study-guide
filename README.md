# prework-study-guide

## Description

This project was created to serve as a study guide for those progressing through the prework. It accomplishes this by containing notes gathered from each section of the prework in a concise and readable format. Also, functionality was added in developer console that randomly suggests a topic to study. Through this projects creation, I learned how to create a basic website through creating and writing index.html, style.css, and script.js files. Also, I practiced the Git and Github workflow by pulling the main branch to my local machine and pushing feature branches to be merged with the main branch.
